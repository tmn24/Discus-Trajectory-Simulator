# Discus-Trajectory-Simulator
Simulates the flight of discus implements with specified initial conditions

The aerodynamic data I used was from a research paper (Too long ago to remember which one) that recorded the aerodynamic coefficients of Lift and Drag at different angles of attack.
This data was then used to create a function model that plots the coefficient of Lift and Drag as a function of angle of attack. Using this data I could simulate how discus implements
travel in air.
